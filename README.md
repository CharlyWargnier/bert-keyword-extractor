# Bert Keyword Extractor

- The BERT Keyword Extractor app is an easy-to-use interface built in
   Streamlit for the amazing KeyBERT library from Maarten Grootendorst!
 - It uses a minimal keyword extraction technique that leverages
   multiple NLP embeddings and relies on Transformers 🤗 to create
   keywords/keyphrases that are most similar to a document. The tool is
   still in Beta
  - Any issues, feedback or suggestions: Gitter chat This
   app is free. If it's useful to you, you can buy me a ☕ to support my
   work. 🙏
